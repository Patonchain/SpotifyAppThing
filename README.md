# SpotifyAppThing
Use GPT to turn a spotify playlist into lyrics and chords for an original song 

1. User provides their spotify api key.  https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/
1. User selects a playlist that they created.
1. "Please wait... generating your first draft."
1. OpenAI returns possible titles, lyrics and chords for a song influenced by the songs in the playlist. Possibly can also create a short tweet length blurb about the song, and a medium length on the process and vibe of the song.
1. User can give feedback to the AI for tweaks, or ask for suggestions on who could sing it (if we want to go the route of getting an AI to do the voice as well)
